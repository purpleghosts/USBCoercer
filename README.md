# USBCoercer: TinyUSB WPAD Coercer Device

USBCoercer turns an ESP32 development board with native USB-OTG into an Ethernet-over-USB gadget capable of coercing proxy configuration via WPAD. It builds on the **TinyUSB Network Control Model (NCM)** example and adds a minimalist DHCP server that injects DHCP option 252 (WPAD/PAC) and, aditionally, classless static routes (option 121) for block EDR telemetry if needed.

The project is intended for security testing and lab demonstrations. Always obtain explicit authorization before using it.

## Key Features

- TinyUSB-based USB NCM Ethernet gadget
- Embedded DHCP server providing optional classless static routes (option 121) and configurable WPAD/PAC URL (option 252).

## Requirements

### Hardware

- ESP32 board with native USB-OTG
- (In some models) USB cable connecting the SoC OTG port to the target machine.
- 
### Software

- Espressif ESP-IDF v5.5 (or newer) with TinyUSB support enabled.
- ESP-IDF toolchain and Python environment installed via the standard `install.sh`/`export.sh` scripts.

## Quick Start

1. **Set up ESP-IDF**
   ```bash
   . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```
2. **Configure the project (optional)**
   ```bash
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```
   Review the `USBCoercer Configuration` menu to tailor the local IP, DHCP pool, WPAD settings, etc.
3. **Build**
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   ```
4. **Flash**
   ```bash
   idf.py flash
   ```

### Default Configuration

`sdkconfig.defaults` provides a lab-friendly setup:

- Local IP: `192.168.7.1/24` with no default gateway.
- DHCP pool of three addresses (`192.168.7.2` â€“ `192.168.7.4`).
- DHCP domain: `badnet`.
- WPAD enabled, pointing to `http://192.168.7.1/wpad.dat`. The firmware starts an embedded HTTP server that delivers this PAC file.
- DNS option disabled (hosts retain their existing DNS servers).
- Static routes and status LED disabled by default.

Adjust `sdkconfig.defaults` or use `menuconfig` to adapt the environment to your tests. Rebuild the firmware (`idf.py build`) after changing any parameters.

## Network Behaviour

- The device exposes itself as a USB NCM Ethernet adapter using the configured MAC address.
- The embedded DHCP server answers `DISCOVER`/`REQUEST` messages with the configured parameters.
- When classless routes are enabled, option 121 is generated dynamically.
- WPAD is enabled and a non-empty URL is provided, so the host retrieves the PAC file from the specified origin and applies the proxy settings.

## Using a NTLM Coercion Mechanism

Currently the deployment requires a **External server:** to point the WPAD URL and to coerce the authentication. Responder is useful for this job. 

## Warnings

- Manipulating WPAD or static routes can redirect traffic from the connected machine. Use this firmware only in controlled environments with informed consent.
- The project targets lab scenarios; it does not implement additional security controls or configuration persistence.

## Acknowledgements

- Based on the official ESP-IDF TinyUSB NCM examples.

Happy (and responsible) hacking!
